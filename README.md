### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dogan Yigit (aka toUpperCase78). I'm an enthusiast of data science, visualization, machine learning; and still continue improving myself for this branch. Though it's a long journey to master thoroughly, I'm striving to read, code and learn new things as much as possible every day.

_More information will be inserted in the upcoming days..._
