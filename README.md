### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dogan Yigit (aka toUpperCase78). I'm an enthusiast of data science, visualization, machine learning; and still continue improving myself in this branch. Though it's a long journey to master everything thoroughly, I'm striving to read, code and learn new things as much as possible every day.

Since the last year, **Data Science** has attracted me the most. That's because, in today's world, vast amount of data is being produced every day in digital environment and in the meantime, many analyses are performed to reveal valuable knowledge. Furthermore, we know that time and space complexities for the methods are necessary for fulfilling the needs efficiently; that's why, it is vital to use state-of-the-art techniques and make them better to conquer **Big Data**.

With this motivation, I've aimed at becoming a professional _Data Scientist_. For this purpose, I've taken several online courses related to Data Science and still proceeding to add new skills. To consolidate them further, I've been making analyses on real-life data or self-created ones. Luckily, GitHub has enabled me to present my works related to Data Science all around the world. Here, you can find them through my repos, and still I'd like to create more in the future!..

Of course, this will not be limited to just Data Science! Besides, there will be many other programming projects I've carried out with passion in my past years as individual repos.
