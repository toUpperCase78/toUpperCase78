### Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dogan Yigit (a.k.a. toUpperCase78). I'm an enthusiast of data science, visualization, machine/deep learning and computer vision. Though it's a long journey to master everything thoroughly, I'm still striving to read, code and learn new things every day.

In the branch of Computer Science, recently **Data Science** has attracted me the most. That's because, in today's world, vast amount of data is being produced every day in digital environment and in the meantime, many analyses should be performed in order to reveal valuable knowledge. Furthermore, we know that time and space complexities for the methods are necessary for fulfilling the needs efficiently; that's why, it is vital to get the hang of the state-of-the-art techniques, especially to conquer **Big Data**.

With this motivation, I aimed for becoming a professional _Data Scientist_. For this purpose, I've taken several online courses and certificates and still proceeding to add new skills. To consolidate them further, I've been making analyses based on real-life data. Thankfully, GitHub has enabled me to present my works all around the world. Here, you can inspect them through my repos, and I'd like to push forward and get even better in the future!

Besides, **Image Processing** is another branch I've been working on for the last several months. That's why, I'm getting my hands on these methods for some fascinating topics, such as object tracking, human pose estimation and gesture recognition.

Of course, this will not be limited to just aforementioned branches! Besides, with my programming experience for over a decade, there will be other projects I've carried out with passion in my past years as individual repos...
