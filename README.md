### Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dogan Yigit (aka toUpperCase78). I'm an enthusiast of data science, visualization, machine/deep learning and computer vision; and still continue improving myself. Though it's a long journey to master everything thoroughly, I'm striving to read, code and learn new things as much as possible every day.

Recently, **Data Science** has attracted me the most. That's because, in today's world, vast amount of data is being produced every day in digital environment and in the meantime, many analyses are performed to reveal valuable knowledge. Furthermore, we know that time and space complexities for the methods are necessary for fulfilling the needs efficiently; that's why, it is vital to get the hang of the state-of-the-art techniques and make them better to conquer **Big Data**.

With this motivation, I aimed for becoming a professional _Data Scientist_. For this purpose, I've taken several online courses and certificates related to Data Science and still proceeding to add new skills. To consolidate them further, I've been making analyses on real-life data. Luckily, GitHub has enabled me to present my works related to Data Science all around the people. Here, you can inspect them through my repos, and I'd like to push forward and progress more in the future!

Besides, **Image Processing** is another branch I've been working on for the last few months. That's why, I'm experimenting several things to get my hands on these methods for some fascinating topics, such as object tracking and human pose estimations.

Of course, this will not be limited to just aforementioned branches! Besides, with my programming experience I've had for many years, there will be other projects I've carried out with passion in my past years as individual repos...

_Any follows presonally and stars on my repos are welcome!_
