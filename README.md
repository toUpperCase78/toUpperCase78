# Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dogan Yigit (a.k.a. toUpperCase78). I'm an enthusiast of **data science, visualization, machine/deep learning, computer vision** and lastly, **backend programming**. Though it's a long journey to master everything thoroughly, I'm still eager to read, code and learn new things every day.

In the branch of Computer Science, **Data Science** has attracted me the most. In today's world, vast amount of data is being produced every day in digital environment and in the meantime, analyses should be performed in order to reveal valuable knowledge. Furthermore, the most optimal time and space complexities for the methods are necessary for fulfilling the needs efficiently; that's why, it is vital to get the hang of the state-of-the-art techniques, especially to conquer **Big Data**.

With this motivation, I aimed for becoming a veteran _Data Scientist_ in a long period. For this purpose, I've taken several online courses, obtained certificates and still proceeding to add things to my toolbox. To consolidate them further, I've been making analyses based on real-life data from time to time. Thankfully, GitHub has enabled me to present my works all around the world. Of course, I'd like to push forward and get even better in the future!

Besides, **Image Processing** is another branch I've been working on since last year. Thus, I'm getting my hands on these methods for some fascinating topics, such as image manipulations, object tracking, human pose estimation and gesture recognition.

This year, I'm headed for **web programming** to understand how the frontend/backend sides are working together in a modern web application. Nonetheless, my focus point is on **the backend side** to run methods related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) efficiently and optimally when requests are received.

_Of course, this will not be limited to just aforementioned topics above! Besides, with my programming experience for over a decade, I'm planning to present other projects I carried out with passion as individual repos..._
